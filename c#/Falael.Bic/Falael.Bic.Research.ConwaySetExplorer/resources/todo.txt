Falael.Bic.GameOfLife.V02 tasks
+ separate the exploration from analysis
	V lock database on read/write
	- run exploration and analysis in separate threads
		- test writing of structs with array fields
		- ConwaySetExplorer won't call analyse immediately after explore, but save the results of every exploration instead (stage01db)
		- analysis will read from stage01db, perform analysis and save the results in stage02db
		- the viewer will monitor stage02db
- split the application in 3 applications
	- explorer - generates stage01db - command line
	- alanyser - monitors stage01db, generates stage02db - command line
	- viewer - monitors and visualizes stage02db - winfroms
- explorer enhancements
	- new configuration
		- GOL_wrapRadius = 17;
		- GOL_activeTreshold = 0;	//	don't use this stat to end experiments
		- GOL_iterationCount = 1700;
		- GOL_experimentRepeatCount = 17;
		+ GOL_pulsationMaxInterval = 4;
	- new initial configurations
		- random, 75% full world
		- random, 50% full world (current)
		- random, 25% full world
		- 1/4 initial random square
		- random 3x3 square
		- central dot
	- detect pulsating generations (analyse GOL_pulsationMaxInterval consequent generations; build an md5 checksum for each generation (encode generations as byte arrays, 15x15 world results in 29 bytes)) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/800463/c-sharp-create-a-hash-for-a-byte-array-or-image
		- finish experiment on pulsation repeat
		- save the generation number of the first occurrance of the pulsation
	- save to db full experiment evolutions, along with configuration and initial conditions used
- analyser enhancements
	- new stats 
		- add min, max and last population, activity and fullness
		- collect the averaged-per-experiment whuber profiles for every generation (see links in directory)
