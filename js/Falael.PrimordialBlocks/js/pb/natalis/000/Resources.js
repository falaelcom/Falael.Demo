	{
		"1xx": { traits: { category: "Informational Response", categoryDescription: "An informational response indicates that the request was received and understood. It is issued on a provisional basis while request processing continues. It alerts the client to wait for a final response. The message consists only of the status line and optional header fields, and is terminated by an empty line. As the HTTP/1.0 standard did not define any 1xx status codes, servers must not send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 compliant client except under experimental conditions." } },
		"2xx": { traits: { category: "Success", categoryDescription: "This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood, and accepted." } },
		"3xx": { traits: { category: "Redirection", categoryDescription: "This class of status code indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request. Many of these status codes are used in URL redirection.\nA user agent may carry out the additional action with no user interaction only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD.A user agent may automatically redirect a request.A user agent should detect and intervene to prevent cyclical redirects." } },
		"4xx": { traits: { category: "Client Error", categoryDescription: "This class of status code is intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included entity to the user." } },
		"5xx": { traits: { category: "Server Error", categoryDescription: "The server failed to fulfil a request.\nResponse status codes beginning with the digit \"5\" indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent condition.Likewise, user agents should display any included entity to the user. These response codes are applicable to any request method." } },

		"1xx.100": { traits: { source: "IANA", code: 100, id: "continue", message: "Continue", description: "The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). Sending a large request body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be inefficient. To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending the body. If the client receives an error code such as 403 (Forbidden) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) then it should not send the request's body. The response 417 Expectation Failed indicates that the request should be repeated without the Expect header as it indicates that the server does not support expectations (this is the case, for example, of HTTP/1.0 servers)." } },

Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.", ref: "(Previously \"Moved Temporarily\")" } },
		"3xx.303": { traits: { source: "IANA", code: 303, id: "seeOther", message: "See Other", description: "The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method.

The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed, for example, by GNU Taler, but that has not yet happened, and this code is not widely used. Google Developers API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests. Sipgate uses this code if an account does not have sufficient funds to start a call.

This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed). This code is also typically used if the request provided authentication by answering the WWW-Authenticate header field challenge, but the server did not accept that authentication.
