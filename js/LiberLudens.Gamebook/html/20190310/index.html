						Liber Ludens is the name of an independent game development team based in Europe. Right now our team's main focus lies in role-playing adventure books for mobile platforms, which our roadmap extends by laying out some exciting new directions like board-, card- and online multiplayer games.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our conviction is that the purpose of gaming vastly transcends sheer entertainment. Playing games means experimenting, it inspires exploration, collaboration and learning, it brings the joy of accomplishment and teaches perseverance. Every game has its story and every story has its moral. Well, maybe some productions put stronger emphasis on the entertainment element, but we believe—we KNOW that gaming can be both fun and fulfilling at the same time. This is what comprises our mission: we are devoted to giving the world games that blend value, fun and a fresh message.

						A role playing short story

						"No Dog's Land" is a one of a kind short story designed as a text-based role-playing game. On its pages it offers a short yet enthralling gameplay, implementing, along its dramatic plot, many core gaming concepts like player stats and skills, valuable items, continual decision making, passage of time, randomized events, and of course - a puzzle to solve. Paving the way for our official, elaborate and engaging Liber Ludens combat engine, its very early version, which comes with "No Dog's Land", enables the player to fight their way through those highly hostile environments.
					</p>

					<p>
						"No Dog's Land" represents a free and early demo, providing a glimpse into the mysterious, dark and intense world of Myrrium, where the action in our first game novel, "Pandemonium Incursion!", is taking place. Sir Wolf, one of the notable historical figures of this epos, finds himself confined in a prison cell located in the dungeon of one of the strongholds of the young and very aggressive Order of the Ivy Cross. Enchained and starving, guarded by swarms of armed order warriors, he is prowling for an opportunity to escape. It is when such an opportunity presents itself that you, the player, come into the picture and take over the steering wheel. Will you manage to navigate the Wolf through the well guarded fortress and its traps and lead him towards successful escape?

						It's an early late spring morning, when Margarita, the princess of the Kingdom of the Woods, wakes up in her Royal chamber, only to discover that, as if overnight, her Kingdom has fallen into chaos. While her parents, King Flesh and Queen Veronica, are dealing with some unfortunate circumstances back in the Royal Palace, she embarks on a quest to restore the balance in the Woods, unveiling in the process hidden games and growing hostilities that have been developing out of sight for some time. Her success in this endeavour is dubious, and it's up to the your resourcefulness and wit whether this story will finish happily or end in disaster.
					</p>

					<p>
						Magic forest folk, beasts and redhats, demons and satanic rituals, ravaged cathedrals and ominus dungeons, Kings and Queens, rival claims to the throne... Mystery and fantasy blend into a suspenseful series of events unfolding in this role-playing choice book, where the reader himself becomes an actor. During reading and playing, you will be challenged to make decisions, solve puzzles and fight villains, steering the plot towards the grand finale. You will become a key figure in an epic clash between truth and illusion, and will be given the chance to disperse the darkness and bring healing to the realm of Myrrium.
					</p>

					<p>
						The release of "Pandemonium Incursion!" is planned for early 2020, with the possibility of a free early demo version coming beforehand. It will offer three full playable chapters, the first of which will be completely free to download and play. Each chapter will track a particular stage of the story, leading towards the dramatic resolution. Following the title release we have furthermore planned thee expansion packs, intended to decorate and extend the current gameplay. You are looking at many hours of reading, playing and fun, so - stay tuned!
