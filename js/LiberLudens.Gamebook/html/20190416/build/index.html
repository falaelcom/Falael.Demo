							Liber Ludens is the name of an independent game development team based in Europe. Right now our

							lies in role-playing adventure books for mobile platforms, which our roadmap extends by laying out

							Our conviction is that the purpose of gaming vastly transcends sheer entertainment. Playing games
							means
							experimenting, it inspires exploration, collaboration and learning, it brings the joy of
							accomplishment and
							teaches perseverance. Every game has its story and every story has its moral. Well, maybe some
							productions put
							stronger emphasis on the entertainment element, but we believe—we KNOW that gaming can be both fun
							and fulfilling
							at the same time. This is what comprises our mission: we are devoted to giving the world games that
							blend value,
							fun and a fresh message.

							"No Dog's Land" is a one of a kind short story designed as a text-based role-playing game. On its
							pages it offers
							a short yet enthralling gameplay, implementing, along its dramatic plot, many core gaming concepts
							like player
							stats and skills, valuable items, continual decision making, passage of time, randomized events, and
							of course - a
							puzzle to solve. Paving the way for our official, elaborate and engaging Liber Ludens combat engine,
							its very
							early version, which comes with "No Dog's Land", enables the player to fight their way through those
							highly
							hostile environments.
						</p>

						<p>
							"No Dog's Land" represents a free and early demo, providing a glimpse into the mysterious, dark and
							intense world
							of Myrrium, where the action in our first game novel, "Pandemonium Incursion!", is taking place. Sir
							Wolf, one of
							the notable historical figures of this epos, finds himself confined in a prison cell located in the
							dungeon of one
							of the strongholds of the young and very aggressive Order of the Ivy Cross. Enchained and starving,
							guarded by
							swarms of armed order warriors, he is prowling for an opportunity to escape. It is when such an
							opportunity
							presents itself that you, the player, come into the picture and take over the steering wheel. Will
							you manage to
							navigate the Wolf through the well guarded fortress and its traps and lead him towards successful
							escape?

							Magic forest folk, beasts and redhats, demons and satanic rituals, ravaged cathedrals and ominus
							dungeons, Kings
							and Queens, rival claims to the throne... Mystery and fantasy blend into a suspenseful series of
							events unfolding
							in this role-playing choice book, where the reader himself becomes an actor. During reading and

							be challenged to make decisions, solve puzzles and fight villains, steering the plot towards the

							It's an early late spring morning, when Margarita, the princess of the Kingdom of the Woods, wakes
							up in her Royal
							chamber, only to discover that, as if overnight, her Kingdom has fallen into chaos. While her
							parents, King Flesh
							and Queen Veronica, are dealing with some unfortunate circumstances back in the Royal Palace, she
							embarks on a
							quest to restore the balance in the Woods, unveiling in the process hidden games and growing
							hostilities that have
							been developing out of sight for some time. Her success in this endeavour is dubious, and it's up to
							the your
							resourcefulness and wit whether this story will finish happily or end in disaster.
						</p>

						<p>
							The release of "Pandemonium Incursion!" is planned for early 2020, with the possibility of a free
							early demo
							version coming beforehand. It will offer three full playable chapters, the first of which will be
							completely free
							to download and play. Each chapter will track a particular stage of the story, leading towards the
							dramatic
							resolution. Following the title release we have furthermore planned thee expansion packs, intended
							to decorate and
							extend the current gameplay. You are looking at many hours of reading, playing and fun, so - stay
							tuned!
