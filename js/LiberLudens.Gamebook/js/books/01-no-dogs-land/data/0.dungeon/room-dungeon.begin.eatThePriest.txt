For a while, the dark dungeon tunnels are filled with eager grumbling and grinding sounds. As you eat you feel your body regaining its natural strength.

When you finish your meal, the echoing dungeon silence returns. You are already staying there for a minute or two, enjoying the pleasant feeling of fullness, when a distant sound brings you out of your bloodthirsty meditation.

What is your luck? Is somebody coming (dice roll is less than 3) or it's just a random noise from the building (dice roll is 3 or more)?
