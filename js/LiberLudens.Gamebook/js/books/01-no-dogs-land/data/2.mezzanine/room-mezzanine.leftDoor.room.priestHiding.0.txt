@mezzanine.leftDoor.state.2@ On your left there's a large window with an amazing view of the mountainside with a beautiful waterfall. But more interestingly, there is a terrified priest squirming in terror in the opposite corner - you identify the one who was engaged in a discussion with the guards downstairs in the entrance hall by the sweet-sour smell he's radiating. When you make a step towards him, he suddenly straightens up, a mad sparkle flickers in his wild eyes, and he attacks you with a short knife.

The smell of this creature triggers your vomit reflex, and, eager to leave, you are already turning away, when a beautiful green glitter makes you stop and turn back.

On the right thumb of the priest there is a @@INSERT global.aventurineRingText@
