You go through the tunnel and there is the old eroded bridge that you have seen from the window. You quickly evaluate your chances to use this place as an escape route. Unfortunately the moat beneath the fortress wall is deep, the opposite slope is too steep for your wolf paws and nails (sometimes you secretly envy the cats who are such superior climbers... but you'd never admit that, of course), and the front side of the shrine is completely vertical and too high to be overcome in one jump. Your only options are to cross the bridge or go back to the fortress.

You go through the tunnel and there is the broken bridge. The distance over the moat is too big for a safe jump so you just stand there and enjooy the fresh wind.
