The structure turns out to contain a single oval room embedded in the rocks of the mountain. When you enter, you curiosly inspect the place. The irregular shape of the ceiling suggests that it was a natural cavity once; the floor is perfectly flat, though.

In the middle is located a heavy whitestone plinth, remarkable by itself with the intricate abstract patterns engraved on its sides, but even more notewothy is what's on top of it. It's an item you'd never expect to find here, in keeping of the dreaded Ivy Cross Order! An intriguing thought enters your mind and you look around at wonder, searching for a clue. There it is - a stone slab reared up against the far end of the curved wall, a carving on its face. It's so worn out of time that the bas relief is barely distingushable, but now that you are already suspecting something, you can see it - it's the sign of the Apex Hound<span class="footnoteAsterisk">*</span> ! "No way!" you exclaim to yourself. Yes, the plinth is supporting one of the mythical mithril jaws... you are already there, holding the jaws and eagerly checking them out... But wait! There is an extra central tooth on both upper and lower jaw! No, it's not "one of", it's THE mithril jaws that thousand years ago belonged to the Gray Ancestor, the most notable Alpha of the Apex Hound!

<div class="footnotes">* The Apex Hound is the name of the legendary ancient Clan of the Greatmount Wolfs, the very powerful predator establishment that ruled Greatmount, Silvercrown, Nordalp and the adjesent woodlands thousand years ago, even before the Great Bloodline Splitting. Only a very few Apex Hound artifacts have survived to the present day, and they are all being kept in the Sacret Canine Den guarded and looked after by the rutheless elders of the Amaruq warewolf clan.

Of course, every puppy loves to listen to the epic stories about these heroic times before bed.</div>
