You spend some time in sniffing along the walls, all around the floor and even under the lower ceiling parts, but there is no hint of a hidden passage leading away from the Ivy Cross fortress. It seems that the only possible way is back, over the moat, back into the dreaded and degraded nest of the religious order.

After you've exhausted all entertainment options offered by the Ancestor armory, namely examining the decorations on the plinth and the slab, you get back to the entrance. Several sad stones mark the begining of the collapsed bridge. On the far end there is a larger portion of the bridge still standing, which works well for you because it shortens the distance and makes it possible for you to get there with a single leap.

You step back several yards, accelerate and throw yourself over the dike, successfully landing on the bridge extension. You quickly jump again, and you're already in the air when you hear the last surviving part of the bridge falling appart and plopping in the water below.

"That was it," you think, standing on the bridge abutment, taking a last look at the amazing place that you have just discovered but must leave so quickly. "For now," you add to yourself. "I'll be back for this, and I won't be alone!"

Then you turn towards the passage and disappear in the shadows.
