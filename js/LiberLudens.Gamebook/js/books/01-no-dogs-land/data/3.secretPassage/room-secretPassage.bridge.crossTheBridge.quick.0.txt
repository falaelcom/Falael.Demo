The bridge looks quite unstable, as if it will crumble under your weight at any moment. You have already reached the middle, when your gut feeling turns out to be right, and a large stone breaks off the bridge and falls into the moat water. You jump instinctively forward, and good thing that you do so because the whole bridge rumbles at once underneath and disappears under water. When you land on all your four on the abutment and look back, you see that only a relatively small part of the stone structure is still staning on the far end accross the moat.

"Well, what'd you know..." you gnarr at the irony of the realization that getting back inside the fortress you so much desire to escape just got a great deal harder.
