@@DEF global.aventurineRingText@ ring of fine crafstmanship made of some precious silvery metal and decorated with an interesting green stone, in which you recognize aventurine - one of the many stones that you've seen at the Redhat's cottage home. You try to remember it's properties... Something about opportunity and success...? Anyways. As a compensation for the moral damages the dreaded Ivy Cross Order owes you much more than an aventurine ring, so you readily remove it from the priest's hand and put it in one of the inner pockets of your leather coat.@@ENDDEF@
