The rythm of your even steps calms your mind, and for a while you enter a light meditative state. After a short time random thoughts start popping up in the silent space of your mind, dissipating immediately to free room for new ones:

"...my name is Margarita the Atramentous Reptile..."

"...I'm the heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Woods..."

"...I'm also an heir to the throne of the Underworld Domain..."

"...it seems that grandfather King Zybar has no plans to retire in the forseeable future, so most likely it will take a long time before I accede the throne of the Underworld Domain..."

"...my father Flesh, King of the Woods and my mother Veronica, Queen of the Woods, are definitely getting older; last year they discussed retirement options..."

"...father wants to move to the semi-active vulcano New Kilauea, where, rumor has it, crystals of unseen beauty can be harvested from the depths of the enormous cave system that lies nearby..."

"...mother is more of an LA<span class="footnoteAsterisk">*</span> fan; she insists that LA will offer better accommodation and hygiene options..."

"...I don't see myself sitting all day in a throne and running a country..."

"...I need change!"

As if in response to your thoughts the texture of the road under your feet changes. Marble pavement replaces the soft pine-needle covering. The path takes a turn, and suddenly there are no more trees. Before your eyes lies the well-kept lawn surrounding the walls of the Royal Palace. The portcullis is open and two soldiers from the Royal Guard are leaning carelessly on the wall engaged in a conversation. You can even see from the distance the electrostatic discharges flickering between their metallic heads<span class="footnoteAsterisk">**</span>. 

You head towards the gate.
